#
# syn-edit — the SynapseOS text editor.
#
# The suite's answer to Kate, and to vim, without being two programs. There is
# ONE editing engine and it is modal; the terminal editor and the graphical
# window are both renderers over it. They collect keys, hand them to the
# engine, and draw what it says the buffer now looks like. Neither contains a
# rule about what a key does.
#
# That is why `ciw`, `:%s/old/new/g`, undo, registers, marks and macros work in
# the window: they are not implemented in the window. It is also why the whole
# thing is testable from a shell script — `syn-edit run --keys 'ggdG' file`
# drives the same engine with no terminal and no display, which is how all 255
# tests exercise it.
#
# Nothing is linked but libc. Regular expressions are POSIX regcomp, compiled
# as BASIC expressions so that a pattern typed out of vim habit behaves the way
# it looks (\( \) group, \| alternates, \+ and \? repeat), with \v switching to
# extended. Syntax highlighting is a table of twenty-odd languages driving one
# tokeniser rather than a parser per language. The clipboard is delegated to
# wl-copy/wl-paste, which is how everything else on this desktop reaches it.
#
# ⚠ Files are opened and saved BYTE-FAITHFULLY. CRLF endings, a missing final
# newline, invalid UTF-8 and embedded NULs all survive a round trip, and the
# permission bits of the file being replaced are preserved. An editor that
# silently "fixes" a missing final newline turns opening a file into a diff.
#
# ⚠ This package does NOT make itself the default text editor. It declares the
# MIME types it can handle, which makes it a candidate; which candidate runs is
# decided by mimeapps.list, and nothing here ships one. Kate keeps whatever it
# already had until somebody chooses otherwise.
pkgname=syn-edit
# pkgver stays 0.1.0 and releases move pkgrel. build-all.sh writes
# "$name-0.1.0.tar.gz" and transforms paths to "$name-0.1.0/" for every
# component, so bumping pkgver leaves makepkg looking for a tarball nothing
# creates.

# 12: A CLICK TYPED ITS OWN COORDINATES INTO THE DOCUMENT. Reported with a
#   screenshot of a buffer reading
#     1G28|1G27|1G27|1G27|viw1G27|1G27|1G27|viw[ ] 1G6|1G11|1G11|1G11|viw
#   — unexplainable from the outside, because not one of those characters was
#   pressed by anybody. They are the mouse's own coordinates: gotoPos() placed
#   the caret by sending the keys a vim user would press, `12G34|`, which is a
#   MOTION in normal mode and THIRTEEN LITERAL CHARACTERS in insert mode. So
#   clicking while typing typed. `viw` is the double-click, and the stray digit
#   before a wheel notch is `3<Up>`'s count.
#   ⚠ THE RIGHT-CLICK PATH HAD ALREADY BEEN PATCHED FOR THIS, in 11, with an
#   <Esc> before the move — and the fix stopped there. The left click, the drag,
#   the double click, the wheel and the scrollbar all still spoke in keys. A bug
#   fixed at one call site and not at the class is a bug that comes back wearing
#   a different button.
#   ⚠ AND ESCAPING FIRST IS NOT THE FIX EITHER. No editor throws you out of
#   insert mode for clicking somewhere, and none puts you into it: the mode has
#   to come out exactly as it went in, in normal, insert AND visual. So the
#   engine gained a `goto <line> <col>` verb that moves the caret and says
#   nothing about the mode, and the window stopped spelling positions as
#   keystrokes. It still EXTENDS a visual selection for free, which is what a
#   drag needs — serve.c sets the caret and the engine reads a selection as
#   anchor→caret, so moving the caret IS extending it.
#   The double click still leaves insert deliberately, because `viw` is a
#   selection and there is no selecting a word while still inserting; the wheel
#   sends three plain motions instead of a count, since the arrows are safe in
#   insert mode and the `3` was not.
#   ⚠ ONE TEST WAS ASSERTING THE SPELLING AND NOT THE RULE: it grepped the QML
#   for the literal `"G")` to prove the scrollbar moves the caret before it
#   states the top. That is load-bearing (a `view` with no caret move is a
#   no-op) but the motion is not, so it now checks the ORDER of gotoPos and
#   `view` and fails only when the rule is actually broken.
#   Nine checks in syn_edit_test.sh, including the old key spelling pinned as
#   the bug — so nobody reintroduces it thinking keys are equivalent.
# 13: THE WINDOW HAD NEVER PASTED, AND BACKSPACE WOULD NOT JOIN A LINE.
#   Reported together, and they are one bug. Ctrl+Shift+V did nothing, and
#   Backspace at the start of line 2 refused to pull it up onto line 1 — the
#   arrow keys had to be used to get there instead.
#   ⚠ THE ENGINE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BOTH OF THEM. In NORMAL mode Backspace IS `h`,
#   a motion that stops dead at column 0 and has never joined a line, and
#   Ctrl+V IS `<C-v>`, a BLOCK SELECTION — so Ctrl+V had not failed to paste,
#   it had never once been asked to. Both are the correct answers to a window
#   that had silently left INSERT, which is what every mouse gesture did: the
#   double click sent `<Esc>viw`, the right click sent `<Esc>`, and nothing
#   anywhere sent the window back. One double click and the keyboard was vim's
#   for the rest of the session, with no indication that anything had changed.
#   ⛔ SO THE WINDOW IS MODELESS NOW, and the terminal editor is untouched.
#   `syn-edit` in a terminal is still vim — tui.c hands raw keys to the engine
#   and none of this is reachable from it. The window stays in INSERT: Ctrl+C,
#   Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V are the clipboard, Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z (and Ctrl+Y)
#   undo and redo, Ctrl+A selects all, Ctrl+F and Ctrl+R find and replace,
#   typing over a selection replaces it, and Escape drops the selection rather
#   than leaving insert.
#   ⚠ NOT DONE BY TEACHING THE WINDOW ABOUT MODES. That is the second editor
#   the whole architecture exists to avoid. serve.c gained six PROTOCOL VERBS —
#   `gui insert|visual|delsel|copy|cut|paste` — each of which states the mode it
#   leaves behind, so no caller has to know the one it started in. Same reason
#   `goto` is a verb (12), and the same rule: a key sequence has to know which
#   mode will read it, and this window has spent its whole life not knowing.
#   Paste INSERTS rather than putting: `"+p` lands after the caret, takes a
#   whole line when the register happens to be linewise, and leaves the caret ON
#   the last character instead of past it.
#   ⚠ AND ONE RULE REPLACES A DOZEN CALL SITES: any frame reporting NORMAL is
#   answered with `gui insert`. Undo, a search finishing, a file opening, a task
#   being ticked and the engine's own first frame all used to leave the window
#   in normal mode, each needing its own patch; this is the one that holds for
#   the ones added later.
#   ⚠ A SELECTION IS ONE FRAME BEHIND, so the window cannot ask the last frame
#   whether something is selected the instant after asking for it — Shift+Right
#   then a letter, typed at any speed, would read "nothing selected" and type
#   without replacing. Every frame carries the serial of the command that
#   produced it, so `sent === acked` says whether the answer is current; while
#   it is not, what the window ASKED FOR is the better answer.
#   ⛔ AND THAT BOOKKEEPING FOUND A SECOND BUG, older than this one: a Process
#   write made before the process has spawned is DROPPED, in silence. The
#   window makes several `view` calls that early, five of which went nowhere —
#   it worked only because a later onRowsChanged said the same thing again.
#   Writes are held until the first frame proves the pipe is live.
#   Paste also reaches the engine's command line, because Find and Replace put
#   the caret there and pasting a search term is the ordinary reason to have one
#   open. Control bytes are dropped: a newline would submit it.
#   ⚠ ONE TEST WAS A FALSE GREEN WAITING TO HAPPEN — it grepped the whole QML
#   for `"+y`, which the comments explaining the change still contain. The QML
#   checks strip comments to a file first, because `set -o pipefail` plus
#   `grep -q` makes `strip | grep` FAIL EXACTLY WHEN IT MATCHES.
#   Forty-one checks in syn_edit_test.sh, the old spellings pinned as the
#   bug. 352 pass.
# 14: THE WINDOW GOT THE LAYOUT IT WAS ASKED FOR — a document list down the
#   left, full height, with a header of its own, and the toolbar, tabs, text
#   and status bar as ONE COLUMN beside it. The list used to be a strip wedged
#   between a toolbar that did not act on it and a status bar about a
#   different pane.
#   A row is a CARD, not a line of text: the NAME is what you look for and the
#   FOLDER is what tells `config.json` in one project from `config.json` in
#   another, and neither fits on one line at this width. The current one
#   carries an accent BAR rather than only a tint — ⚠ wash() is the accent at
#   16% over the panel, which on a pale theme is a few percent of luminance:
#   legible on the dark preset and invisible on Prism. A solid bar is the same
#   shape on both.
#   ⛔ AND THE WINDOW COULD NOT CLOSE A DOCUMENT AT ALL. It opened buffers and
#   switched between them and never let one go — the list only ever grew, and
#   `:bd` was the only way out of a window that exists so nobody has to know
#   `:bd`. Every row has an ✕ now.
#   ⚠ `:bd` REFUSES ON A MODIFIED BUFFER — "unsaved changes (:bd! to discard)"
#   — which is right in a terminal and a dead end in a window, the same shape
#   as the Save button that could refuse but not ask (see 0.1.0-9). So the
#   window asks: save and close, discard, or cancel.
#   ⚠ AND THE CLOSE CANNOT SIMPLY BE SENT AFTER THE SAVE. A write can fail, and
#   `bd` behind a failed save refuses with ITS message — overwriting
#   "Permission denied" with "unsaved changes", which is the wrong thing about
#   the wrong problem. The save's own frame is the verdict, found by the serial
#   it carries (13's bookkeeping, earning its keep).
#   ⛔ CLOSING THE LAST DOCUMENT IS REFUSED IN doClose(), not only by hiding the
#   button: `:bd` on a single buffer sets quit, so the difference between the
#   two is a stray click and a whole session.
#   ⚠ A POSITIONER REFUSES TO LAY OUT AN ANCHORED CHILD, and the child then
#   contributes NOTHING to the positioner's implicit height. The question
#   rendered its sentence and NO BUTTONS, in a bar sized to fit them — not a
#   clipped button, an invisible one. ToolButton gained `centered: false` for
#   use inside a Flow or a Column; every existing caller is a Row, which
#   happens to survive it.
#   The tab strip got a toolbar switch too — it says the same thing the
#   sidebar now says, and its only control had been a typed `:set tabbar!` in a
#   window that exists so nobody has to type that.
#   The panel's edge drags, and `treewidth` is a new option so a panel sized
#   once stays sized. ⚠ THE WINDOW'S `set` IS WRITTEN DOWN NOW AND A TYPED
#   `:set` IS NOT: a panel closed with a button and a sidebar dragged to a
#   width are preferences, and a window that forgets them on every launch has
#   to be rearranged every morning. A typed :set is vim's, and vim's answer is
#   "this session".
#   The B record gained a sixth field, "has a path" — the sidebar needs it to
#   know whether Close can offer to save, and matching the "[No Name]" label
#   would be matching a message.
#   Twenty-four checks in syn_edit_test.sh, including the layout's anchors:
#   a wrong one does not error, it just draws a window arranged badly, which
#   nothing notices and nobody reports. 376 pass.
